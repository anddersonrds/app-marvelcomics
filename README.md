## SPA - Single Page Application with React

### Proposed Challenge

Create a Single Page Application from a comic book information application. The Application consist of two screens: <br />

- Screen 1: You should have a list of comics, with the photo and description of each one. When you click on one of the comics, you must navigate to Screen 2.<br />

- Screen 2: You must have the detailed information of the selected comic, with the bigger picture and more information than those listed in screen 1.<br />

It is important to get the comic listing from a server. there is the marvel api [https://developer.marvel.com/](https://developer.marvel.com/) or you can upload your own server using json-server [https://github.com/typicode/json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) with the data you need. Any similar solution is also valid.<br />
